Several suggestions for CM

Saving medals after rounds in a record for other marines to view (sort of like looking up someone's medical history), RP impetus would be medals for past action, and simply the marine would roleplay as if the medals were gotten from fighting CLF forces or some other threat, never directly mentioning or RPing that they know about aliens. Basically just a way to accumulate "swag" points between players.

Keeping track of and using money more often - commissary onboard, run by cargo that sells additional "attachments" or other loot that's available to paying customers only. Also, coffee and snacks etc, cost money now. Payments received per round based on rank, making job bans a real consequence because now there's a limit to how much money you can "earn." Also perhaps a playtime counter to increase pay for players who have been around for a long time. Maybe some arbitrary flavor text somewhere (perhaps run through the CL as additional RP) allowing players to invest or purchase out of game things, aka: "hey CL I'd like to send this 10,000$ home to my wife for a new garage."

Triage 2.0: unique action/item "triage kit" or such that is inconsumable but allows medics to effectively stabilize patients instead of spamming trauma kits. Example, a player has lost an arm and has 250 brute damage to that limb, the medic's trauma kit can only stop the bleeding and reduce the brute damage slightly, thus the player keeps going "dead" even though the medic is trying to attend to the player and focusing completely on him. Essentially a way to force down that brute damage without actually healing, roleplayed/flavor-texted as applying a tourniquet or compression to a limb/area to keep the patient from going critical over and over, would require constant interaction from the medic to function as "attending to the wound since it is so critical." Behaves similarly to the defibrilator. Maybe a help intent function instead of an item, just like CPR.

Armories automatically unlock/open at code RED or code DELTA isntead of requiring someone to press a button somewhere.

Authorized drugs appear in vendors inside marine refit for medics (if peridaxon gets authorized, it appears to medics in their spawn vendors)

Medical research that allows marines to deploy a "sensor jammer" which can interrupt hivemind communication in a certain area.
